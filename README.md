ðŸ©º AI-Powered Medical Image Classifier ðŸ“·ðŸ¤–
I just finished building a JavaFX desktop application that connects to Flask APIs to deploy 4 deep learning models for medical diagnosis:
âœ… Chest X-ray â€“ Detects pneumonia
âœ… Diabetic Retinopathy â€“ Eye disease detection
âœ… Bone Fracture â€“ Identifies fracture vs. no fracture
âœ… Brain Tumor â€“ Tumor classification
ðŸ’¡ Tech & AI Details:
Deep Learning Architecture: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Data Preparation: Image preprocessing & data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming, brightness adjustment) to improve accuracy
Backend: Flask (Python) APIs, each serving a trained model
Frontend: JavaFX with a clean, styled UI
Languages & Tools: Python, Java, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV
ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Next?
I plan to upgrade this application with more AI models to cover additional medical imaging task.
